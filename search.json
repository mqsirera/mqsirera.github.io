    "text": "Current projects\n\n\nJARVIS: Disjoint Large Language Models on Radio VLANs for Intelligent Services\n\nOur project proposes JARVIS, a distributed framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), which splits model layers across edge devices with limited compute resources. This approach enhances resilience to individual node failures through peer-level communication and layer redundancy. Evaluated using Google’s Gemma LLM (2B parameters) over 18 software-defined radios in the NSF Colosseum RF emulator, JARVIS demonstrates robustness in tactical environments by balancing computation and communication.\n\nNeural Point Processes for Pixel-wise Regression\n\nThis project addresses the challenge of pixel-wise regression problems with sparsely annotated images. Traditional methods struggle with unlabeled areas, leading to distorted predictions. We introduce Neural Point Processes, combining 2D Gaussian Processes with neural networks to leverage spatial correlations between sparse labels. Our method significantly improves mean-squared error and R2 scores, outperforming standard regression techniques across both real-world and synthetic datasets.\n\nExtension of Communication-Aware DNN Pruning\n\nIn this project, we extend the work on communication-aware deep neural network (DNN) pruning. We focus on training networks to be deployed in a distributed fashion, reducing the need for information exchange while maintaining high accuracy. This approach aims to optimize network performance by balancing computational load and communication efficiency, ensuring robust deployment in distributed environments."
