    "text": "Current projects\n\n\nDistributed Large Language Models inference in challenging environments\n\nWe are actively building upon the JARVIS project—a distributed framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that intelligently partitions model layers across edge devices with constrained computational resources. Read the original paper in Research.\nJARVIS introduces enhanced resilience to node failures through peer-to-peer communication and layer redundancy, ensuring reliable performance even in challenging conditions. We evaluated this framework with Google’s Gemma LLM (2B parameters), deploying it on 18 software-defined radios in the NSF Colosseum RF emulator and a 7-node Raspberry Pi testbed.\nOur results demonstrate JARVIS’s robustness in tactical environments, achieving an optimal balance between computation and communication for real-world applications.\n\nNeural Point Processes for Pixel-wise Regression\n\nIn this project we address the challenge of pixel-wise regression problems with sparsely annotated images. Traditional methods struggle with unlabeled areas, leading to distorted predictions. We introduce Neural Point Processes, combining 2D Gaussian Processes with neural networks to leverage spatial correlations between sparse labels. Our method significantly improves mean-squared error and \\(R^{2}\\) scores, outperforming standard regression techniques across both real-world and synthetic datasets.\n\nExtension of Communication-Aware DNN Pruning\n\nIn this project, we extend the work on communication-aware deep neural network (DNN) pruning. We focus on training networks to be deployed in a distributed fashion, reducing the need for information exchange while maintaining high accuracy. This approach aims to optimize network performance by balancing computational load and communication efficiency, ensuring robust deployment in distributed environments."
