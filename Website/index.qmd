## Current projects
- **Survey on LLMs for 6G**

Our project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey on the utilization of Language Models (LLMs) in the context of 6G technology. We will investigate how LLMs are shaping the landscape of 6G development, exploring their applications, benefits, and potential challenges. By gathering valuable insights from industry experts and researchers, we seek to gain a deeper understanding of how LLMs are influencing the future of 6G.

- **Practical use for LLMs in telecomms**

Our project is centered around the fine-tuning of a Language Model (LLM) to act as a seamless bridge between network configurations and operators, all through natural language interactions. We're dedicated to creating an intuitive and efficient interface that allows operators to communicate with network configurations effortlessly. By harnessing the power of LLMs, we aim to streamline network management and enhance operational efficiency, ultimately revolutionizing the way operators interact with and manage complex networks.
